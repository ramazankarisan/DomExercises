# Extreme Travel Website!

**Tasks**:

- Select the `header` that is the closest to the first `h1` heading. Give the `header` a solid border of 5px.

- If the `.info` section contains an `.info-package`, select all `package-title`s and give the title's previous element a border.

- Check if the label's class matches "mild". If so, give the label a yellow solid border. If the label's class matches "intense", give the label an orange solid border. If the class does not match either, give the label a red solid border.

- Add all the children of the `.nav-list` to the footer's unordered list, `.site-map`. Note: the `.nav-list` should still contain its children.
