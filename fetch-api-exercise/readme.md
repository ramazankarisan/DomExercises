# Fetch API Assignment

## Tasks:

- Create a webpage to show the users from a given API [reqres](https://reqres.in/).
- you should fetch from this url : `https://reqres.in/api/users/`
- you have to work with data array to loop and render it to HTML.
- you can use `async` `await` or you can use`then`
- you can style the html as you want (bootstrap or pure css)

## What were provided:

- An API were ready.

## What I coded:

- I fetched the data from the API.
- I have used npm package `parcel` as a compiler and imported `bootstrap`.
- Instead of creating each element separately, I have used also a template in order to get use to _React_.
- `app.js` and `index.html` were coded by me.
